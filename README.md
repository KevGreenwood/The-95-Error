**The 95% Error** is a modification (fork) of the game *The 95% Threshold*, originally created by Alva Majo (Vanesa Mayonesa).  

This new version brings improvements and adds new features to enhance the gameplay experience.  

## Gameplay  
In this game, you control a unique spaceship with one goal: reach the highest score possible. However, there’s a twist—there’s a 95% chance that every time you shoot, your ship will self-destruct. Can you master the odds and achieve victory?

### Musical Mode 🎵  
Take your experience to the next level with **Musical Mode**! Play to the rhythm of your favorite tracks—MP3 audio is fully supported.

### A Small Detail for Audio Purists  
Yes, the volume uses a **logarithmic scale**, just as it should. 🎚️
